## C Programming - Bit Manipulations

In this project, I will be exploring various bit manipulation tasks using C programming language.

## Tasks

1. **Binary to Unsigned Int:**

I will write a function that converts a binary string to an unsigned integer. The function will return 0 if there are invalid characters in the binary string or if the string is `NULL`.

2. **Print Binary Representation:**

I will write a function that prints the binary representation of a given unsigned long integer. The function should not use arrays, malloc, or modulo or division operators.

3. **Get Bit Value:**

I will write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index. The function will return the value of the bit at index `index`, starting from 0, or -1 if an error occurred.

4. **Set Bit to 1:**

I will write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index. The function will return 1 if the operation succeeded, or -1 if an error occurred.

5. **Set Bit to 0:**

I will write a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index. The function will return 1 if the operation succeeded, or -1 if an error occurred.

6. **Calculate Flip Bits:**

I will write a function that calculates the number of bits that need to be flipped to convert one number to another. The function should not use the modulo or division operators.

7. **Detect Endianness:**

I will write a function that detects the endianness of the system. The function will return 0 if the system is big-endian, or 1 if little-endian.

8. **Find the Password:**

I will find the password for this program by following the instructions in the file `101-password`.
