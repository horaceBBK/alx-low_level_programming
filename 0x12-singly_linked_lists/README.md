# Understanding Singly Linked Lists in C

## Overview

Welcome to this README, where we explore the concept of singly linked lists in C programming. Singly linked lists are a fundamental data structure that allows dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion and deletion of elements.

## What are Singly Linked Lists?

A singly linked list is a linear data structure consisting of nodes, where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node in the sequence. The last node points to NULL, indicating the end of the list.

## Basic Structure of a Node

In C, a node in a singly linked list can be represented using a structure:

```c
struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node* next;
};
