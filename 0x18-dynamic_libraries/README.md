# 0x18 C - Dynamic Libraries

In this project, I will be tackling the following tasks related to dynamic libraries in C. The tasks cover creating dynamic libraries, generating them from various source files, and exploring the interaction between C and Python. The numbering starts from 0.

## Tasks Overview

### Task 0: A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life

Create the dynamic library `libdynamic.so` containing functions for character manipulation, string operations, and mathematical calculations. Prototypes are provided in the `main.h` file.

### Task 1: Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future

Write a script to create a dynamic library named `liball.so` from all the .c files in the current directory.

### Task 2: Let's call C functions from Python

Create a dynamic library with C functions that can be called from Python. The goal is to enhance interoperability between the two languages.

### Task 3: Code injection: Win the Giga Millions!

Given the Giga Millions program and the opportunity to run two commands on the same server, attempt to increase the chances of winning the jackpot using code injection. The use of LD_PRELOAD is encouraged.

*Tip: LD_PRELOAD*
