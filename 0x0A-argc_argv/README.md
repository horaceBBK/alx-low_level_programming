# Handling Command-Line Arguments in C: `argc` and `argv`

Welcome to this README, where we explore the topic of handling command-line arguments in C using the `argc` and `argv` parameters. Understanding command-line arguments is essential for building C programs that can accept input and options from the command line.

## What are `argc` and `argv`?

In C, `argc` stands for "argument count," and `argv` stands for "argument vector." They are parameters typically passed to the `main` function and are used to handle command-line arguments.

- `argc`: It represents the number of arguments passed to the program, including the program name itself.

- `argv`: It is an array of strings where each string is one of the arguments. `argv[0]` is typically the program name, and the subsequent elements contain the actual arguments.

## Usage Example

Here's a simple example of how to use `argc` and `argv`:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    printf("Program Name: %s\n", argv[0]);
    
    if (argc > 1) {
        printf("Arguments:\n");
        for (int i = 1; i < argc; i++) {
            printf("%d: %s\n", i, argv[i]);
        }
    } else {
        printf("No arguments provided.\n");
    }
    
    return 0;
}


Benefits of Command-Line Arguments
Customization: Users can customize program behavior by passing arguments, such as file paths or options, at runtime.

Scripting: Command-line arguments make it easy to integrate C programs into scripts and automation workflows.

Batch Processing: Batch processing tasks can utilize command-line arguments to process multiple files or data.
